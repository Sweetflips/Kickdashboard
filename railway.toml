# Railway configuration
# This file defines build settings for different services
# Each service in Railway can override these settings via the dashboard

[build]
# Default build uses the main Dockerfile for the web service
builder = "dockerfile"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

# Worker service should be configured in Railway dashboard:
# - Create a new service from the same repo
# - Set environment variable: RUN_AS_WORKER=true
# OR
# - Set Dockerfile path to: Dockerfile.worker
